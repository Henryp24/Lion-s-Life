    <h1>Scarface</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div>
<p>Meet a living legend, Scarface. 

        His coalition, the Musketeers, protect the Paradise Pride …
        
        the most lethal pride in the Mara. ,<br>
        
        Their specialty is picking off tired animals as they cross the Great Mara River.<br> 
        
        A male lion coalition roams their territory, mating and protecting one or two prides. <br>
        
        Yet Scar has definitely shown preference to the Paradise Pride. 
        <br>
        They’re a family: nine females, nine cubs, and six young males. <br>
        
        Adulthood isn’t guaranteed for all of them
        
        And those that make it will surely develop scars and stories of their own..</p>
